      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        LogToMetricReportsCollection: Record the occurrence to the metric report collection.
        RedfishEvent: Send a Redfish event message containing the metric report.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        LogToMetricReportsCollection: This value shall indicate the service records
          the occurrence to the metric report collection found under the telemetry
          service.  The service shall update the metric report based on the setting
          of the ReportUpdates property.
        RedfishEvent: This value shall indicate the service sends a Redfish event
          of type MetricReport to subscribers in the event subscription collection
          of the event service.

    MetricReportDefinition_v1_3_7_ReportUpdatesEnum:
      description: Handling of subsequent metric reports when a metric report exists.
      enum:
      - Overwrite
      - AppendWrapsWhenFull
      - AppendStopsWhenFull
      - NewReport
      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        AppendStopsWhenFull: New information is appended to the metric report.  The
          service stops adding entries when the metric report has reached its maximum
          capacity.
        AppendWrapsWhenFull: New information is appended to the metric report.  The
          metric report entries are overwritten with new entries when the metric report
          has reached its maximum capacity.
        NewReport: A new metric report is created, whose identifier is a service-defined
          identifier concatenated with the timestamp.
        Overwrite: Overwrite the metric report.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        AppendStopsWhenFull: This value shall indicate the service appends new information
          to the metric report referenced by the MetricReport property.  The service
          shall stop adding entries when the metric report has reached its maximum
          capacity.  The State property within Status should be set to `Disabled`
          and the MetricReportDefinitionEnabled property should be set to `false`
          when the append limit is reached.
        AppendWrapsWhenFull: This value shall indicate the service appends new information
          to the metric report referenced by the MetricReport property.  The service
          shall overwrite entries in the metric report with new entries when the metric
          report has reached its maximum capacity.
        NewReport: This value shall indicate the service creates a new metric report
          resource, whose Id property is a service-defined identifier concatenated
          with the timestamp.  The metric report referenced by the MetricReport property
          shall reference the metric report most recently created by this metric report
          definition.
        Overwrite: This value shall indicate the service overwrites the metric report
          referenced by the MetricReport property.
      x-longDescription: This type shall indicate how the service handles subsequent
        metric reports when a metric report exists.
