          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the total number of NAKs
            issued on the PCIe link by the receiver.  A NAK is issued by the receiver
            when it detects that a TLP from this device was missed.  This could be
            because this device did not transmit it, or because the receiver could
            not properly decode the packet.

          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the total number of NAKs

            when it detects that a TLP from the receiver was missed.  This could be

        ReplayCount:

          format: int64
          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          type: integer
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the total number of the replays
            issued on the PCIe link by this device.  A replay is a retransmission
            of a TLP and occurs because the ACK timer is expired, which means that
            the receiver did not send the ACK or this device did not properly decode
            the ACK.

          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          type: integer
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the total number of the replay
            rollovers issued on the PCIe link by this device.  A replay rollover occurs
            when consecutive replays failed to resolve the errors on the link, which
            means that this device forced the link into the recovery state.
