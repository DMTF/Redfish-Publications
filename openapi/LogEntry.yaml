      description: The `LogEntry` schema defines the record format for a log.  It
        is designed for Redfish event logs, which utilize messages defined in a Message
        Registry and referenced by a `MessageId`.  For standard message definitions,
        see DSP2065.  Other log formats, including OEM-specific definitions and the
        IPMI System Event Log (SEL) are also supported.  The `EntryType` field indicates
        the type of log and the resource includes several additional properties dependent
        on the `EntryType`.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent the log format for log services
        in a Redfish implementation.
