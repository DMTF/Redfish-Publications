      description: The `AccountService` schema defines an account service.  The properties
        are common to, and enable management of, all user accounts.  The properties
        include the password requirements and control features, such as account lockout.  Properties
        and actions in this service specify general behavior that should be followed
        for typical accounts, however implementations might override these behaviors
        for special accounts or situations to avoid denial of service or other deadlock
        situations.
