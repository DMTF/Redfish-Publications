      description: The `OutboundConnection` schema defines how the Redfish service
        connects to a remote client over a WebSocket connection.  This allows a service
        behind a firewall to establish a connection to a remote client outside of
        the firewall.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent the connection configuration
        necessary to connect to a remote client.  Services shall initiate the outbound
        connection over a WebSocket defined in the 'Outbound connections' clause of
        the Redfish Specification.
