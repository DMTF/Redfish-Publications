            value should be unique and generated using a random or a pseudo-random
            generator.  The service shall send this value to the TPM in the 'qualifyingData'

            Library Specification, that identifies the signing scheme to use for the
            TPM attestation key.  The service shall send this value to the TPM in
            the 'inScheme' parameter of the 'TPM2_Quote' command defined in the Trusted
