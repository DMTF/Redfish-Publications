      description: The ManagerAccount schema defines the user accounts that are owned
        by a manager.  Changes to a manager account might affect the current Redfish
        service connection if this manager is responsible for the Redfish service.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a user account for the manager
        in a Redfish implementation.  The account shall indicate the allowed access
        to one of more services in the manager.
