        Compute: This resource block contains resources of type `Processor` and `Memory`
          in a manner that creates a compute complex.
        ComputerSystem: This resource block contains resources of type `ComputerSystem`.
        Expansion: This resource block is capable of changing over time based on its
          configuration.  Different types of devices within this resource block can
          be added and removed over time.
        IndependentResource: This resource block is capable of being consumed as a
          standalone component.  This resource block can represent things such as
          a software platform on one or more computer systems or an appliance that
          provides composable resources and other services, and can be managed independently
          of the Redfish service.
        Memory: This resource block contains resources of type `Memory`.
        Network: This resource block contains network resources, such as resource
          of type `EthernetInterface` and `NetworkInterface`.
        Processor: This resource block contains resources of type `Processor`.
        Storage: This resource block contains storage resources, such as resources
          of type `Storage` and `SimpleStorage`.
