          readOnly: true
          x-longDescription: This property shall represent the id of the Redfish Service
            instance.  The format of this string shall contain a 32-byte value in
            the form 8-4-4-4-12.  If SSDP is used, this value shall be an exact match
            of the UUID value returned in a 200 OK from an SSDP M-SEARCH request during
            discovery.  RFC4122 describes methods to use to create a UUID value.  The
            value should be considered to be opaque.  Client software should only
            treat the overall value as a universally unique identifier and should
            not interpret any sub-fields within the UUID.
