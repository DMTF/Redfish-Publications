          description: The state of the boot source override feature.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: false
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain `Once` for a one-time boot
            override, and `Continuous` for a remain-active-until-cancelled override.  The
            `Continuous` value is not supported for this property for UEFI boot source
            override because UEFI supports one-time boot only.  If set to `Once`,
            the value is reset to `Disabled` after the BootSourceOverrideTarget actions
            have completed successfully.  Changes to this property do not alter the
            BIOS persistent boot order configuration.

          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the source to boot the system
            from, overriding the normal boot order.  The Redfish.AllowableValues annotation
            specifies the valid values for this property.  `Pxe` indicates to PXE
            boot from the primary NIC; `Floppy`, `Cd`, `Usb`, and `Hdd` indicate to
            boot from their devices respectively.  `BiosSetup` indicates to boot into
            the native BIOS screen setup.  `Utilities` and `Diags` indicate to boot
            from the local utilities or diags partitions.  `UefiTarget` indicates
            to boot from the UEFI device path found in UefiTargetBootSourceOverride.  `UefiBootNext`
            indicates to boot from the UEFI BootOptionReference found in BootNext.  Changes
            to this property do not alter the BIOS persistent boot order configuration.

          type: string
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the UEFI device path of the
            override boot target.  The Redfish.AllowableValues annotation specifies
            the values for this property.  The `Continuous` value is not supported
            for the BootSourceOverrideEnabled property for UEFI boot source override
            because UEFI supports one-time boot only.  Changes to this property do
            not alter the BIOS persistent boot order configuration.

      - PoweringOn
      - PoweringOff
      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        'Off': The system is powered off, although some components may continue to
          have AUX power such as management controller.
        'On': The system is powered on.
        PoweringOff: A temporary state between on and off.  The power off action can
          take time while the OS is in the shutdown process.
        PoweringOn: A temporary state between off and on.  This temporary state can
          be very short.
