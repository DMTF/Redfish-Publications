      description: In Redfish, a manager is a systems management entity that may implement
        or provide access to a Redfish service.  Examples of managers are BMCs, enclosure
        managers, management controllers, and other subsystems that are assigned manageability
        functions.  An implementation may have multiple managers, which may or may
        not be directly accessible through a Redfish-defined interface.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a management subsystem for
        a Redfish implementation.
