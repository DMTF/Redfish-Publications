      description: In Redfish, a manager is a systems management entity that can implement
        or provide access to a Redfish service.  Examples of managers are BMCs (baseboard
        management controllers), enclosure managers, management controllers, and other
        subsystems that are assigned manageability functions.  An implementation can
        have multiple managers, which might be directly accessible through a Redfish-defined
        interface.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a management subsystem for
        a Redfish implementation.
