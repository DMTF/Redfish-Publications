      description: In Redfish, a manager is a systems management entity that can implement
        or provide access to a Redfish service.  Examples of managers are BMCs, enclosure
        managers, management controllers, and other subsystems that are assigned manageability
        functions.  An implementation can have multiple managers, which might be directly
        accessible through a Redfish-defined interface.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a management subsystem for
        a Redfish implementation.
