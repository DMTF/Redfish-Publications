        GracefulRestart: Shut down gracefully and restart the system.
        GracefulShutdown: Shut down gracefully and power off.
        Nmi: Generate a diagnostic interrupt, which is usually an NMI on x86 systems,
          to stop normal operations, complete diagnostic actions, and, typically,
          halt the system.
        'On': Turn on the unit.
        PowerCycle: Power cycle the unit.  Behaves like a full power removal, followed
          by a power restore to the resource.

          the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value `Off`.
        ForceOn: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power
          on state.  The transition will start immediately.  Upon successful completion,
          the PowerState property shall contain the value `On`.
        ForceRestart: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a

        GracefulRestart: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to
          a power on state, after transiting through a restart.  The transition will
          start after first performing tasks to safely shutdown the resource.  For
          example, when shutting down a computer system, the hosted operating system
          is allowed to safely shutting down processes and close connections.  Upon
          successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain
          the value `On`.
        GracefulShutdown: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to
          a power off state.  The transition will start after first performing tasks
          to safely shutdown the resource.  For example, when shutting down a computer
          system, the hosted operating system is allowed to safely shutdown processes
          and close connections.  Upon successful completion, the PowerState property,
          if supported, shall contain the value `Off`.
        Nmi: This value shall indicate the resource will generate a diagnostic interrupt.
        'On': This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power on
          state.  Upon successful completion, the PowerState property, if supported,
          shall contain the value `On`.
        PowerCycle: This value shall indicate the resource will transition to a power
          off state, then transition to a power on state.  Upon successful completion,
          the PowerState property, if supported, shall contain the value `On`.
        PushPowerButton: This value shall indicate the resource will behave as if
          the physical power button is pressed.  The behavior of pressing the physical
          power button might be dependent on the state of the unit and the behavior
          might be configurable.
