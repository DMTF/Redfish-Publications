      description: The AccountService schema defines an Account Service.  The properties
        are common to, and enable management of, all user accounts.  The properties
        include the password requirements and control features, such as account lockout.  The
        schema also contains links to the manager accounts and roles.

            attempt and the reset of the lockout threshold counter.  This value must
            be less than or equal to the AccountLockoutDuration value.  A reset sets

            from the last failed login attempt when the AccountLockoutThreshold counter,
            which counts the number of failed login attempts, is reset to `0`.  Then,
            AccountLockoutThreshold failures are required before the account is locked.  This
            value shall be less than or equal to the AccountLockoutDuration value.  The
            threshold counter also resets to `0` after each successful login.  If

            within the period between the last failed login attempt and the reset
            of the lockout threshold counter.  If this value is `0`, no lockout will
            occur.  If the AccountLockoutCounterResetEnabled value is `false`, this
            property is ignored.

            the AccountLockoutThreshold value, within the AccountLockoutCounterResetAfter
            window of time.  The value shall be greater than or equal to the AccountLockoutResetAfter
            value.  If this value is `0`, no lockout shall occur.  If AccountLockoutCounterResetEnabled
            value is `false`, this property shall be ignored.
