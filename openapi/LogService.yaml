      description: The `LogService` schema contains properties for monitoring and
        configuring a log service.  When the `Id` property contains `DeviceLog`, the
        log contains device-resident log entries that follow the physical device when
        moved from system-to-system, and not a replication or subset of a system event
        log.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a log service for a Redfish
        implementation.  When the `Id` property contains `DeviceLog`, the log shall
        contain log entries that migrate with the device.
