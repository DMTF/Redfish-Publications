      description: The LogService schema contains properties for monitoring and configuring
        a log service.  When the Id property contains `DeviceLog`, the log contains
        device-resident log entries that follow the physical device when moved from
        system-to-system, and not a replication or subset of a system event log.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a log service for a Redfish
        implementation.  When the Id property contains `DeviceLog`, the log shall
        contain log entries that migrate with the device.
