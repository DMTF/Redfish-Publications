      description: The `Processor` schema describes the information about a single
        processor that a system contains.  A processor includes both performance characteristics,
        clock speed, architecture, core count, and so on, and compatibility, such
        as the CPU ID instruction results.  It also describes the location, such as
        a slot, socket, or bay, where a unit can be installed, by populating a resource
        instance with an absent state if a unit is not present.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a single processor that a system
        contains.  A processor includes both performance characteristics, clock speed,
        architecture, core count, and so on, and compatibility, such as the CPU ID
        instruction results.  It may also represent a location, such as a slot, socket,
        or bay, where a unit may be installed, but the `State` property within the
        `Status` property contains `Absent`.
