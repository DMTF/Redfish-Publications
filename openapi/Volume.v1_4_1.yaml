          to adddress write hole issue.
        Oem: The policy that is Oem specific.
        'Off': The volume is not using any policy to address the write hole issue.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        DistributedLog: The policy that distributes additional log (e.q. cheksum of
          the parity) among the volume's capacity sources to address write hole issue.
          Additional data is used to detect data corruption on the volume.
        Journaling: The policy that uses separate block device for write-ahead logging
          to adddress write hole issue. All write operations on the RAID volume are
          first logged on dedicated journaling device that is not part of the volume.
        Oem: The policy that is Oem specific. The mechanism details are unknown unless
          provided separatly by the Oem.
        'Off': The support for addressing the write hole issue is disabled. The volume
