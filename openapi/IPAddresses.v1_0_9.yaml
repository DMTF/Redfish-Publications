          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the current RFC4862-defined
            state of this address.  Preferred and Deprecated states follow the definitions
            in RFC4862, section 5.5.4.  The Tentative state indicates that the address
            is undergoing Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), as defined in RFC4862,
            section 5.4.  The Failed state indicates a static address that did not
            pass DAD.  A static address in the Failed state is not in use on the network
            stack, and corrective action is required to remedy this condition.
