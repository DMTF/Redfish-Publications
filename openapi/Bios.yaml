      description: The Bios schema contains properties related to the BIOS Attribute
        Registry.  The Attribute Registry describes the system-specific BIOS attributes
        and actions for changing to BIOS settings.  Changes to the BIOS typically
        require a system reset before they take effect.  It is likely that a client
        finds the `@Redfish.Settings` term in this Resource, and if it is found, the
        client makes requests to change BIOS settings by modifying the Resource identified
        by the `@Redfish.Settings` term.
      x-longDescription: This Resource shall represent BIOS attributes for a Redfish
        implementation.
