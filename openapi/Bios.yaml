      description: The Bios schema contains properties related to the BIOS Attribute
        Registry.  The Attribute Registry describes the system-specific BIOS attributes
        and Actions for changing to BIOS settings.  Changes to the BIOS typically
        require a system reset before they take effect.  It is likely that a client
        will find the @Redfish.Settings term in this resource, and if it is found,
        the client makes requests to change BIOS settings by modifying the resource
        identified by the @Redfish.Settings term.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall be used to represent BIOS attributes
        for a Redfish implementation.
