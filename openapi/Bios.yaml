      description: The Bios schema contains properties related to the BIOS attribute
        registry.  The attribute registry describes the system-specific BIOS attributes
        and actions for changing to BIOS settings.  Changes to the BIOS typically
        require a system reset before they take effect.  It is likely that a client
        finds the `@Redfish.Settings` term in this resource, and if it is found, the
        client makes requests to change BIOS settings by modifying the resource identified
        by the `@Redfish.Settings` term.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent BIOS attributes for a Redfish
        implementation.
