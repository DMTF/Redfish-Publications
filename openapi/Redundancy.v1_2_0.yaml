          description: This is the redundancy mode of the group.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          x-longDescription: The value of this property shall contain the information
            about the redundancy mode of this manager.  Failover shall indicate a
            master/slave type arrangement where status indicates the role of this
            manager.  N+1 indicates an arrangement where the redundancy set needs
            MaxNumSupported-1 number of resources in order to be redundant.  Load
            Balanced indicates all members are active. However, there functionality
            is not independent of each other. Their functioning is determined by some
            sort of load balancing algorithm. Sparing is implied (i.e. each member
            can be a spare for the other(s). Sparing indicates that all members are
            active and are aware of each others. However, their functionality is independent
            until failover. Each member can be a spare for the other(s). Limited Sparing
            indicates that all members are active, and they may or may not be aware
            of each and they are not spares for each other.

      x-enumDescriptions:
        Failover: Failure of one unit will automatically cause its functions to be
          taken over by a standby or offline unit in the redundancy set.
        N+m: Multiple units are available and active such that normal operation will
          continue if one or more units fail.
        Sharing: Multiple units contribute or share such that operation will continue,
          but at a reduced capacity, if one or more units fail.
        Sparing: One or more spare units are available to take over the function of
          a failed unit, but takeover is not automatic.
