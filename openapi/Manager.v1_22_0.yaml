      x-enumDescriptions:
        AuxiliaryController: A controller that provides management functions for a
          particular subsystem or group of devices as part of a larger system.
        BMC: A controller that provides management functions for one or more computer
          systems.  Commonly known as a BMC (baseboard management controller).  Examples
          of this include a BMC dedicated to one system or a multi-host manager providing
          BMC capabilities to multiple systems.
        EnclosureManager: A controller that provides management functions for a chassis,
          group of devices, or group of systems with their own BMCs (baseboard management
          controllers).  An example of this is a manager that aggregates and orchestrates
          management functions across multiple BMCs in an enclosure.
        FabricManager: A controller that primarily monitors or manages the operation
          of a group of fabric attached nodes and switches.
        ManagementController: A controller that primarily monitors or manages the
          operation of a device or system.
        RackManager: A controller that provides management functions for a whole or
          part of a rack.  An example of this is a manager that aggregates and orchestrates
          management functions across multiple managers, such as enclosure managers
          and BMCs (baseboard management controllers), in a rack.
        Service: A software-based service that provides management functions.
