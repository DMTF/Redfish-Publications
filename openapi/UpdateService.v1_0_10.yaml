          type: string
          x-longDescription: This parameter shall contain an RFC3986-defined URI that
            links to a software image that the update service retrieves to install
            software in that image.  This URI should contain a scheme that describes

            within this URI, the service shall use HTTP to get the image.

            parameter is ignored if the URI provided in ImageURI contains a scheme.
          x-longDescription: This parameter shall contain the network protocol that
            the update service shall use to retrieve the software image located at
            the ImageURI.  Services should ignore this parameter if the URI provided
            in ImageURI contains a scheme.  If this parameter is not provided (or
            supported), and a transfer protocol is not specified by a scheme contained
            within this URI, the service shall use HTTP to retrieve the image.
