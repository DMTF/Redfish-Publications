          description: The type of reset.
          x-longDescription: This parameter shall contain the type of reset.  The
            service can accept a request without the parameter and complete an implementation-specific
            default reset.  Services should include the @Redfish.AllowableValues annotation
            for this parameter to ensure compatibility with clients, even when ActionInfo
            has been implemented.
      type: object
      x-longDescription: This action shall reset the chassis.  Additionally, it may
        reset systems or other contained resources depending on the ResetType used
        to invoke this action.
