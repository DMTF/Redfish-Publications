      description: The `PCIeDevice` schema describes the properties of a PCIe device
        that is attached to a system.  It also describes the location, such as a slot,
        socket, or bay, where a unit can be installed, by populating a resource instance
        with an absent state if a unit is not present.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a PCIe device in a Redfish
        implementation.  It may also represent a location, such as a slot, socket,
        or bay, where a unit may be installed, but the `State` property within the
        `Status` property contains `Absent`.
    PCIeDevice_PCIeErrors:
      $ref: http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/PCIeDevice.v1_19_0.yaml#/components/schemas/PCIeDevice_v1_19_0_PCIeErrors
      description: The PCIe errors associated with this device.
      x-longDescription: This property shall contain properties that describe the
        PCIe errors associated with this device.
    PCIeDevice_PCIeInterface:
      $ref: http://redfish.dmtf.org/schemas/v1/PCIeDevice.v1_19_0.yaml#/components/schemas/PCIeDevice_v1_19_0_PCIeInterface
      description: This type describes a PCIe Interface.
      x-longDescription: This type shall describe the PCIe interface characteristics
        of a PCIe device.
