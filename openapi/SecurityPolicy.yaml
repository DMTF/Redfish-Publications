      description: The `SecurityPolicy` resource provides a central point to configure
        the security policy of a manager.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent configurable security-related
        policies managed by a manager.  All security parameters in other resources
        that are controlled by the manager shall follow the related settings in this
        security policy.  For example, an outbound TLS connection established per
        an `EventDestination` resource will follow the values of the properties in
        the `TLS` property.
