          x-longDescription: This property shall be a boolean that determines when
            the HttpPushUriTargets property is being used by a client for firmware
            updates. A client should set this property to True when it is using HttpPushUriTargets
            for firmware update, and should set it to False when it is no longer using
            HttpPushUriTargets for updates. The property can provide multiple clients
            a way to negotiate ownership of HttpPushUriTargets. This will help clients
            to know if a firmware update using HttpPushUriTargets is used by another
            client. This property has no functional requirements for the Service.
