      description: This type describes coolant.
      x-longDescription: This type shall describe the coolant used with a device.
    CoolingLoop_CoolingLoop:

      description: The `CoolingLoop` schema describes a cooling loop.  A cooling loop
        might be any coolant-carrying vessel, such as facility-level pipework, an
        immersion cooling tank, or a manifold.  A loop might describe its connectors
        and instrumentation but does not generally include active cooling components
        or subsystems.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a cooling loop for a Redfish
        implementation.
