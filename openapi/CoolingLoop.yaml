      description: This schema describes a cooling loop.  A cooling loop might be
        any coolant-carrying vessel, such as facility-level pipe work, an immersion
        cooling tank, or a manifold.  A loop might describe its connectors and instrumentation,
        but does not generally include active cooling components or subsystems.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a cooling loop for a Redfish
        implementation.
