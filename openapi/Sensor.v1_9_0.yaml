          description: A user-defined value at which the reading is considered above
            normal range but not yet fatal.
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain a user-defined value at which
            the `Reading` property is considered above the normal range but is not
            yet fatal.  The value of the property shall use the same units as the
            `Reading` property.  The `Reading` property shall be considered above
            normal range if either the `UpperCritical` or `UpperCriticalUser` threshold
            has been violated.  This property is used to provide an additional, user-defined
            threshold value when the `UpperCritical` threshold is implemented as read-only
            to reflect a service-defined value that cannot be changed.

          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the value at which the `Reading`
            property is above the normal range and is fatal.  The value of the property
            shall use the same units as the `Reading` property.

      x-longDescription: This object shall contain the set of thresholds that derive
        a sensor's health and operational range.
