          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the parameters of the action
            URI for a resolution step.

          type: string
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the action URI for a resolution
            step.

          description: The OEM extension property.
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the OEM extensions.  All
            values for properties contained in this object shall conform to the Redfish
            Specification-described requirements.
        Priority:
          description: The priority in the set of resolution steps.
          format: int64
          minimum: 0
          nullable: true
          readOnly: true
          type: integer
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the priority in the set of
            resolution steps.  The value `0` shall indicate the highest priority.  Increasing
            values shall represent decreasing priority.  If two or more resolution
            steps have the same priority, the execution order of the resolution steps
            shall be in array order.  If a resolution step does not have a priority
            assignment, the default is 0.  The priority is used to determine the execution
            order of the resolution steps.
