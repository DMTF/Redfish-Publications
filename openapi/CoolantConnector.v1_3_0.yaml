      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        LeakDetected: This value shall indicate a leak was detected by an external
          source.  The `Health` of the resource may be affected by this change in
          state.  The `Health`, `State`, and `Condition` properties within `Status`
          should reflect the reaction taken by the service in response to a detected
          leak.
        Normal: This value shall indicate a normal operation of the valve, or a return
          to a normal operating state.  The `State` property within `Status` shall
          reflect the chosen value of `ValveState`, where a value of `Open` shall
          indicate an `Enabled` state, and a `Closed` value shall indicate a `Disabled`
          state.
        NotInUse: This value shall indicate the valve is not in use or is not connected,
          and therefore should remain closed.  The `State` property within `Status`
          shall indicate `Absent`.
