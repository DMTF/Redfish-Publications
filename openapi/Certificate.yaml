      description: The Certificate schema describes a certificate that proves the
        identify of a component, account, or service.
      x-longDescription: This Resource contains a certificate for a Redfish implementation.
    CertificateType:
      enum:
      - PEM
      - PKCS7
      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        PEM: A Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)-encoded certificate.
        PKCS7: A Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)-encoded PKCS7 certificate.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        PEM: The format of the certificate shall contain a Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM)-encoded
          string, containing RFC5280-defined structures.
        PKCS7: The format of the certificate shall contain a Privacy Enhanced Mail
          (PEM)-encoded string, containing RFC5280- and RFC2315-defined structures.  The
          Service may discard additional certificates or other data in the structure.
    KeyUsage:
      description: The usages of a key contained within a certificate.
      enum:
      - DigitalSignature
      - NonRepudiation
      - KeyEncipherment
      - DataEncipherment
      - KeyAgreement
      - KeyCertSign
      - CRLSigning
      - EncipherOnly
      - DecipherOnly
      - ServerAuthentication
      - ClientAuthentication
      - CodeSigning
      - EmailProtection
      - Timestamping
      - OCSPSigning
      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        CRLSigning: Verifies signatures on certificate revocation lists (CLRs).
        ClientAuthentication: TLS WWW client authentication.
        CodeSigning: Signs downloadable executable code.
        DataEncipherment: Directly enciphers raw user data without an intermediate
          symmetric cipher.
        DecipherOnly: Deciphers data while performing a key agreement.
        DigitalSignature: Verifies digital signatures, other than signatures on certificates
          and CRLs.
        EmailProtection: Email protection.
        EncipherOnly: Enciphers data while performing a key agreement.
        KeyAgreement: Key agreement.
        KeyCertSign: Verifies signatures on public key certificates.
        KeyEncipherment: Enciphers private or secret keys.
        NonRepudiation: Verifies digital signatures, other than signatures on certificates
          and CRLs, and provides a non-repudiation service that protects against the
          signing entity falsely denying some action.
        OCSPSigning: Signs OCSP responses.
        ServerAuthentication: TLS WWW server authentication.
        Timestamping: Binds the hash of an object to a time.
      x-longDescription: This type shall describe the usages of a key within a certificate,
        as specified by the 'Key Usage' and 'Extended Key Usage' definitions in RFC5280.
