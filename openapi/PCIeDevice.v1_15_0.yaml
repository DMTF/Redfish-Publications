            PCIe communication is a packet that has encountered errors at the data
            link layer.  When a DLLP is considered bad, it means it has been corrupted

          type: integer
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the total number of replays
            issued on the PCIe link by this device.  A replay is a retransmission
            of a TLP and occurs because the ACK timer is expired, which means that
            the receiver did not send the ACK or this device did not properly decode
            the ACK.

          x-longDescription: This property shall contain the total number of replay
            rollovers issued on the PCIe link by this device.  A replay rollover occurs
            when consecutive replays failed to resolve the errors on the link, which
