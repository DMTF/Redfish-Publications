        Continue: Job is to resume operation.
        Exception: Job has stopped due to an exception condition.
        Interrupted: Job has been interrupted.
        Invalid: Job is invalid.
        New: A new job.

        Suspended: Job has been suspended.
        UserIntervention: Job is waiting for user intervention.
        Validating: Job is validating.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        Cancelled: This value shall indicate that the operation completed because
          the job was cancelled by an operator.  The job may restart in the future
          based on the scheduling configuration of the job or operations performed
          by a user.
        Completed: This value shall indicate that the operation completed successfully
          or with warnings.  The job may restart in the future based on the scheduling
          configuration of the job or operations performed by a user.
        Continue: This value shall indicate that the operation has been resumed from
          a paused condition and should return to a Running state.
        Exception: This value shall indicate that the operation completed with errors.  The
          job may restart in the future based on the scheduling configuration of the
          job or operations performed by a user.
        Interrupted: This value shall indicate that the operation has been interrupted
          but is expected to restart and is therefore not complete.
        Invalid: This value shall indicate that validation has determined that the
          system is not properly configured to run the document-based job.  To perform
          validation checks again, perform the `Validate` action.
        New: This value shall indicate that this job is newly created but the operation
          has not yet started.  This shall be the initial state for document-based
          jobs.  Upon receiving the `Validate` action, or if the value of `ValidationPolicy`
          in the `JobService` resource contains `Automatic`, the document-based job's
          `JobState` shall transition to `Validating`.  If the `ValidationPolicy`
          property in the `JobService` resource contains `Bypass`, the `JobState`
          for a document-based job shall transition to `Pending`.
        Pending: This value shall indicate that the operation is pending some condition
          and has not yet begun to execute.
        Running: This value shall indicate that the operation is executing.  Jobs
          that complete successfully shall transition from this state to the `Completed`
          state.  Jobs that do not complete successfully shall transition from this
          state to the `Exception` state.
        Service: This value shall indicate that the operation is now running as a
          service and expected to continue operation until stopped or killed.
        Starting: This value shall indicate that the operation is starting.
        Stopping: This value shall indicate that the operation is stopping but is
          not yet complete.
        Suspended: This value shall indicate that the operation has been suspended
          but is expected to restart and is therefore not complete.  To resume a job,
          perform the `Resume` action.
        UserIntervention: This value shall indicate that the operation is waiting
          for a user to intervene and needs to be manually continued, stopped, or
          cancelled.
        Validating: This value shall indicate that the document-based job is validating
          the state of the system to determine if it can run.  For example, a job
          that runs on factory equipment might check to ensure that the equipment
          is properly configured and has sufficient ingredients to run the job.  If
          the validation checks fail, the job shall transition to the `Invalid` state.  If
          the validation checks are successful, the job shall transition to the `Pending`
          state.
