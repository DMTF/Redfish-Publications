          type: string
          x-longDescription: This parameter shall contain an RFC3986-defined URI that
            links to a software image that the update service retrieves to install
            software in that image.  This URI should contain a scheme that describes

          x-longDescription: This parameter shall contain the network protocol that
            the update service shall use to retrieve the software image located at
            the ImageURI.  Services should ignore this parameter if the URI provided
            in ImageURI contains a scheme.  If this parameter is not provided (or
            supported), and a transfer protocol is not specified by a scheme contained
            within this URI, the service shall use HTTP to retrieve the image.

            the service requires the `Content-Length` header for POST requests to
            this URI, the service should return HTTP 411 if the client does not include
            this header in the POST request.
