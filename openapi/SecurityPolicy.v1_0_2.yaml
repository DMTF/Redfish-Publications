          readOnly: true
          x-longDescription: This property shall contain a link to a resource collection
            of type `CertificateCollection` that represents the set of trusted TLS
            certificates.  Certificates in this collection may contain leaf certificates,
            partial certificate chains, or complete certificate chains, where a partial
            certificate chain is a chain containing only CA certificates.  If `VerifyCertificate`
            contains the value `true` and if a TLS endpoint verifies successfully
            against a partial chain or exactly matches a leaf certificate, that TLS
            endpoint shall be considered verified and other authentications checks
            are performed.
        VerifyCertificate:
          description: An indication of whether the manager will verify the certificate
            of the remote TLS endpoint.
          nullable: true
          readOnly: false
          type: boolean
          x-longDescription: This property shall indicate whether the manager will
            verify the certificate of the remote endpoint in a TLS connection.  If
            `true`, the manager shall verify the remote endpoint certificate with
            the certificates found in the collections referenced by the `RevokedCertificates`
            and `TrustedCertificates` properties.  If `false` or not present, the
            manager shall not perform verification of the endpoint certificate.
      type: object
      x-longDescription: This object shall contain TLS policy settings.
