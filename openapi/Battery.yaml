      description: The Battery schema describes a battery unit, such as those used
        to provide systems with power during a power loss event.  It also describes
        the location, such as a slot, socket, or bay, where a unit can be installed,
        by populating a resource instance with an absent state if a unit is not present.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a battery for a Redfish implementation.  It
        may also represent a location, such as a slot, socket, or bay, where a unit
        may be installed, but the State property within the Status property contains
        `Absent`.
