      description: The `Battery` schema describes a unit of energy storage, including
        batteries and supercapacitors, used to provide systems or components within
        a system with power during a power-loss event or to store energy for later
        use.  It also describes the location, such as a slot, socket, or bay, where
        a unit can be installed by populating a resource instance with an absent state
        if a unit is not present.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent an energy storage device for
        a Redfish implementation.  It may also represent a location, such as a slot,
        socket, or bay, where a unit may be installed if the `State` property within
        the `Status` property contains `Absent`.
