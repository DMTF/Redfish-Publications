        Failover: Failure of one unit will automatically cause its functions to be
          taken over by a standby or offline unit in the redundancy set.
        N+m: Multiple units are available and active such that normal operation will
          continue if one or more units fail.
        NotRedundant: The subsystem is not configured in a redundancy mode, either
          due to configuration or the functionality has been disabled by the user.
        Sharing: Multiple units contribute or share such that operation will continue,
          but at a reduced capacity, if one or more units fail.
        Sparing: One or more spare units are available to take over the function of
          a failed unit, but takeover is not automatic.
