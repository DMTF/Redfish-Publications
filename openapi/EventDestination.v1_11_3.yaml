          and attempts at delivery of future events shall continue regardless of the
          number of retries, but issued over time according to a service-defined backoff
          algorithm.
        SuspendRetries: The subscription is suspended after the maximum number of

          over time according to a service-defined backoff algorithm.  The backoff
          algorithm may insert an increasing amount of delay between retry attempts
