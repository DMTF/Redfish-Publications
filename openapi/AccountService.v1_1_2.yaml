            attempt at which point the lockout threshold counter for the account is
            reset to zero. Must be less than or equal to AccountLockoutDuration.
          minimum: 0
          readOnly: false
          type: number
          x-longDescription: This property shall reference the threshold of time in
            seconds from the last failed login attempt at which point the AccountLockoutThreshold
            counter (that counts number of failed login attempts) is reset back to
            zero (at which point AccountLockoutThreshold failures would be required
            before the account is locked).  This value shall be less than or equal
            to AccountLockoutDuration. The threshold counter also resets to zero after
            each successful login.

        AccountLockoutDuration:
          description: The time in seconds an account is locked after the account
            lockout threshold is met. Must be >= AccountLockoutResetAfter. If set
            to 0, no lockout will occur.

          nullable: true
          readOnly: false
          type: number
          x-longDescription: This property shall reference the period of time in seconds
            that an account is locked after the number of failed login attempts reaches
            the threshold referenced by AccountLockoutThreshold, within the window
            of time referenced by AccountLockoutCounterResetAfter.  The value shall
            be greater than or equal to the value of AccountLockoutResetAfter.  If
            set to 0, no lockout shall occur.
          x-units: s
        AccountLockoutThreshold:
          description: The number of failed login attempts before a user account is

          type: number
          x-longDescription: This property shall reference the threshold of failed
            login attempts at which point the user's account is locked.  If set to
            0, no lockout shall ever occur.

          type: number
          x-longDescription: This property shall reference the threshold for when
            an authorization failure is logged.  This represents a modulo function
            value, thus the failure shall be logged every nth occurrence where n represents
            the value of this property.
