      description: The AggregationSource schema is used to represent the source of
        information for a subset of the resources provided by a Redfish service.  It
        can be thought of as a provider of information.  As such, most such interfaces
        have requirements to support the gathering of information like address and
        account used to access the information.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent an aggregation source for a
        Redfish implementation.
