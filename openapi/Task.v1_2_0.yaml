          description: The state of the task.
          readOnly: true
          x-longDescription: The value of this property shall indicate the state of
            the task.  New shall be used to indicate that the task is a new task which
            has just been instantiated and is in the initial state and indicates it
            has never been started.  Starting shall be used to indicate that the task
            is moving from the New, Suspended, or Service states into the Running
            state.  Running shall be used to indicate that the Task is running.  Suspended
            shall be used to indicate  that the Task is stopped (e.g., by a user),
            but can be restarted in a seamless manner.  Interrupted shall be used
            to indicate  that the Task was interrupted (e.g., by a server crash) in
            the middle of processing, and the user should either re-run/restart the
            Task.  Pending shall be used to indicate  that the Task has been queued
            and will be scheduled for processing as soon as resources are available
            to handle the request.  Stopping shall be used to indicate that the Task
            is in the process of moving to a Completed, Killed, or Exception state.  Completed
            shall be used to indicate that the task has completed normally.  Killed
            shall be used to indicate  that the task has been stopped by a Kill state
            change request (non-graceful shutdown).  Exception shall be used to indicate  that
            the Task is in an abnormal state that might be indicative of an error
            condition.  Service shall be used to indicate that the Task is in a state
            that supports problem discovery, or resolution, or both.  This state is
            used when a corrective action is possible.
