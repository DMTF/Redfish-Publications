          type: array
          x-longDescription: The list of references to server certificates for the
            server referenced by the `ServerURI` property.  Members of this array
            shall reference members the `EnrollmentCACertificates` property in the
            `CertificateService` resource.  If `VerifyCertificate` contains `true`
            and this property is present, services shall compare the certificates
            in this list with the certificate obtained during handshaking with the
            enrollment server in order to verify the identity of the enrollment server.  If
            `VerifyCertificate` contains `true` and this property is absent, services
            shall compare the certificates in the `EnrollmentCACertificates` property
            in the `CertificateService` resource with the certificate obtained during
            handshaking with the enrollment server.  If the server cannot be verified,
            the service shall fail the automatic certificate enrollment.  If `VerifyCertificate`
            is `false`, the service shall not perform certificate verification.  Regardless
            of the contents of this list and the `EnrollmentCACertificates` property
            in the `CertificateService` resource, services may perform additional
            verification based on other factors, such as the configuration of the
            `SecurityPolicy` resource.
