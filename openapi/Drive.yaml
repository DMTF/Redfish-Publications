      description: The `Drive` schema represents a single physical drive for a system,
        including links to associated volumes.  It also describes the location, such
        as a slot, socket, or bay, where a unit can be installed, by populating a
        resource instance with an absent state if a unit is not present.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a drive or other physical storage
        medium for a Redfish implementation.  It may also represent a location, such
        as a slot, socket, or bay, where a unit may be installed, but the `State`
        property within the `Status` property contains `Absent`.
