      description: The `Memory` schema represents a memory device, such as a DIMM,
        and its configuration.  It also describes the location, such as a slot, socket,
        or bay, where a unit can be installed, by populating a resource instance with
        an absent state if a unit is not present.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a memory device in a Redfish
        implementation.  It may also represent a location, such as a slot, socket,
        or bay, where a unit may be installed, but the `State` property within the
        `Status` property contains `Absent`.
