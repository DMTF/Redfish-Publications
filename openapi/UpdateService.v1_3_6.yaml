            software in that image.  This URI should contain a scheme that describes

          x-longDescription: This parameter shall contain the network protocol that
            the update service shall use to retrieve the software image located at
            the ImageURI.  Services should ignore this parameter if the URI provided
            in ImageURI contains a scheme.  If this parameter is not provided (or
            supported), and a transfer protocol is not specified by a scheme contained

          x-longDescription: This property shall contain a link to a resource collection
            of type SoftwareInventoryCollection.  The resource collection should contain
            the set of software components generally referred to as platform firmware
            or that does not execute within a host operating system.  Software in

            service supports an HTTP or HTTPS POST of a software image for the purpose
            of installing software contained within the image.  Access to this URI
            shall require the same privilege as access to the update service.  If
            the service requires the `Content-Length` header for POST requests to
            this URI, the service should return HTTP 411 if the client does not include
            this header in the POST request.

            where to apply the update image when using the URI specified by the HttpPushUri
            property to push a software image.  These targets should correspond to
            SoftwareInventory instances or their related items.  If this property
            is not present or contains no targets, the service shall apply the software
            image to all applicable targets, as determined by the service.

          type: boolean
          x-longDescription: This property shall indicate whether any client has reserved
            the HttpPushUriTargets property for firmware updates.  A client should
            set this property to `true` when it uses HttpPushUriTargets for firmware
            updates.  A client should set it to `false` when it is no longer uses
            HttpPushUriTargets for updates.  The property can provide multiple clients
            a way to negotiate ownership of HttpPushUriTargets and helps clients determine
            whether another client is using HttpPushUriTargets to make firmware updates.  This
            property has no functional requirements for the service.
