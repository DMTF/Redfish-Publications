      description: The AccountService schema contains properties for managing user
        accounts. The properties are common to all user accounts, such as password
        requirements, and control features such as account lockout. The schema also
        contains links to the collections of Manager Accounts and Roles.

        AccountLockoutCounterResetAfter:
          description: The interval of time in seconds between the last failed login
            attempt and reset of the lockout threshold counter. This value must be
            less than or equal to AccountLockoutDuration. Reset sets the counter to
            zero.

          type: number
          x-longDescription: This property shall reference the threshold of time in
            seconds from the last failed login attempt at which point the AccountLockoutThreshold
            counter (that counts number of failed login attempts) is reset back to
            zero (at which point AccountLockoutThreshold failures would be required
            before the account is locked).  This value shall be less than or equal
            to AccountLockoutDuration. The threshold counter also resets to zero after
            each successful login.

            the threshold referenced by AccountLockoutThreshold, within the window
            of time referenced by AccountLockoutCounterResetAfter.  The value shall
            be greater than or equal to the value of AccountLockoutResetAfter.  If
            set to 0, no lockout shall occur.
          x-units: s
        AccountLockoutThreshold:
          description: The number of failed login attempts allowed before a user account
            is locked for a specified duration. A value of 0 means it is never locked.
          minimum: 0
          nullable: true

          type: number
          x-longDescription: This property shall reference the threshold of failed
            login attempts at which point the user's account is locked.  If set to

          description: The number of authorization failures allowed before the failure
            attempt is logged to the manager log.
          minimum: 0
          readOnly: false
          type: number
          x-longDescription: This property shall reference the threshold for when
            an authorization failure is logged.  This represents a modulo function
            value, thus the failure shall be logged every nth occurrence where n represents
            the value of this property.
