      description: The RegisteredClient schema defines the record format for a registered
        client.  It is designed to allow well behaved clients to register with a Redfish
        service such that other clients are aware the service might be configured
        or monitored by the client.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a registered client  for a
        Redfish implementation.  It is not expected that transient tools, such as
        a short lived CLI tool, register.  Clients and management tools that live
        for long periods of time can create RegisteredClient resources so that other
        clients are aware the service might be configured or monitored by the client.
