      type: string
      x-enumDescriptions:
        Failover: Failure of one unit automatically causes a standby or offline unit
          in the redundancy set to take over its functions.
        N+m: Multiple units are available and active such that normal operation will
          continue if one or more units fail.
        Sharing: Multiple units contribute or share such that operation will continue,
          but at a reduced capacity, if one or more units fail.
        Sparing: One or more spare units are available to take over the function of
          a failed unit, but takeover is not automatic.
