            for the purpose of installing software contained within the image.  The
            value of this property should not contain a URI of a Redfish resource.  See

          x-longDescription: This property shall contain a link to a resource collection
            of type CertificateCollection that represents the server certificates
            for the server referenced by the ImageURI property in SimpleUpdate.  If
            VerifyRemoteServerCertificate is `true`, services shall compare the certificates
            in this collection with the certificate obtained during handshaking with
            the image server in order to verify the identify of the image server prior
            to transferring the image.  If the server cannot be verified, the service
            shall not send the transfer request.  If VerifyRemoteServerCertificate
            is `false`, the service shall not perform certificate verification with
            certificates in this collection.  Regardless of the contents of this collection,
            services may perform additional verification based on other factors, such
            as the configuration of the SecurityPolicy resource.

          x-longDescription: This property shall contain a link to a resource collection
            of type SoftwareInventoryCollection.  The resource collection should contain
            the set of software components executed in the context of a host operating
            system.  This can include device drivers, applications, or offload workloads.  Software
            in this collection is generally updated using operating system-centric
            methods.

          readOnly: false
          type: boolean
          x-longDescription: This property shall indicate whether the service will
            verify the certificate of the server referenced by the ImageURI property
            in SimpleUpdate prior to sending the transfer request with the certificates
            found in the collection referenced by the RemoteServerCertificates property.  If
            this property is not supported by the service, it shall be assumed to
            be `false`.  This property should default to `false` in order to maintain
            compatibility with older clients.  Regardless of the value of this property,
            services may perform additional verification based on other factors, such
            as the configuration of the SecurityPolicy resource.
