      description: The Event schema describes the JSON payload received by an Event
        Destination (which has subscribed to event notification) when events occurs.  This
        resource contains data about event(s), including descriptions, severity and
        MessageId reference to a Message Registry that can be accessed for further
        information.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall be used to represent an event for a Redfish
        implementation.
    EventType:
      deprecated: true
      enum:
      - StatusChange
      - ResourceUpdated
      - ResourceAdded
      - ResourceRemoved
      - Alert
      - MetricReport
      - Other
      type: string
      x-deprecatedReason: Starting Redfish Spec 1.6, subscriptions are based on RegistryId
        and ResourceType and not EventType.
      x-enumDescriptions:
        Alert: A condition exists which requires attention.
        MetricReport: A metric report managed by the Telemetry Service is being sent.
        Other: As of Redfish Specification v1.6, EventType has been deprecated. The
          event is therefore based on a Registry or Resource, not an EventType.
        ResourceAdded: A resource has been added.
        ResourceRemoved: A resource has been removed.
        ResourceUpdated: The value of this resource has been updated.
        StatusChange: The status of this resource has changed.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        MetricReport: Events of type MetricReport shall be sent to a client in accordance
          with the MetricReport schema definition.
        Other: Events of type 'Other' shall be sent to a client in accordance with
          subscriptions to RegistryPrefixes or ResourceTypes.
      x-enumVersionAdded:
        MetricReport: v1_3_0
        Other: v1_4_0
      x-versionDeprecated: v1_3_0
