      description: The `Event` schema describes the JSON payload received by an event
        destination, which has subscribed to event notification, when events occur.  This
        resource contains data about events, including descriptions, severity, and
        a message identifier to a message registry that can be accessed for further
        information.
      x-longDescription: This resource contains an event for a Redfish implementation.
    Event_EventType:
      deprecated: true
      enum:
      - StatusChange
      - ResourceUpdated
      - ResourceAdded
      - ResourceRemoved
      - Alert
      - MetricReport
      - Other
      type: string
      x-deprecatedReason: Starting with Redfish Specification v1.6 (Event v1.3), subscriptions
        are based on the `RegistryPrefix` and `ResourceType` properties and not on
        the `EventType` property.
      x-enumDescriptions:
        Alert: A condition requires attention.
        MetricReport: The telemetry service is sending a metric report.
        Other: Because `EventType` is deprecated as of Redfish Specification v1.6,
          the event is based on a registry or resource but not an `EventType`.
        ResourceAdded: A resource has been added.
        ResourceRemoved: A resource has been removed.
        ResourceUpdated: A resource has been updated.
        StatusChange: The status of a resource has changed.
      x-enumLongDescriptions:
        MetricReport: Events of type `MetricReport` shall be sent to a client in accordance
          with the `MetricReport` schema definition.
        Other: Events of type `Other` shall be sent to a client in accordance with
          subscriptions to `RegistryPrefixes` or `ResourceTypes`.
      x-enumVersionAdded:
        MetricReport: v1_3_0
        Other: v1_4_0
      x-versionDeprecated: v1_3_0
