      description: The `PowerSupply` schema describes a power supply unit.  It also
        describes the location, such as a slot, socket, or bay, where a unit can be
        installed, by populating a resource instance with an absent state if a unit
        is not present.
      x-longDescription: This resource shall represent a power supply unit for a Redfish
        implementation.  It may also represent a location, such as a slot, socket,
        or bay, where a unit may be installed, but the `State` property within the
        `Status` property contains `Absent`.
