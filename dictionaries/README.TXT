Support note for Redfish release 2019.4
----------------------------------------

Due to changes necessary to the RDE Dictionary Generator to support Redfish schema "excerpts", dictionary files have been omitted for the affected schemas.  Four schemas are affected:  Circuit, Outlet, OuletGroup, and PowerDistributionMetrics.  Support for schema excerpts will be added to the RDE Dictionary Generator shortly, and we expect dictionaries for the affected schemas to appear in the next release bundle.
